I am a third year graduate student studying Statistics Education at the Univeristy of Minnesota in the Department of Educational Psychology. After completing my bachelors degree in Mathematics at St. Lawrence University, I continued on to get my Masters in Statistics from Iowa State University. During my time at ISU I developed a passion for teaching and decided to pursue a Ph.d. in Statistics Education.
